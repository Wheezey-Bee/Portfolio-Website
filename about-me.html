    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Who are you and what are you doing?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Phoebe Purvis. I am a 2021 Graduate in Mathematics and English from the University of Dundee. Since graduating, I've worked as a Conversational AI Developer with Geniuslead and am currently working as a Prodution Operator with Teledyne. Outside of work and university, I've been teaching myself more about software development and data science, and have been working on my own projects. I hope to finish some of these and post them soon to both this website and my github (which you can find in the footer of this page!)</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How does this background make you unique?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I first approached the technology sector from a mathematics viewpoint. For one of my dissertations, I looked at how you can use mathematics to create poetry, and how these methods were created. While I began with looking at sequences like the Fibonnaci, or algorithms like the Oulipo did, I soon found different types of AI that had been used to create poems. These creative examples of machine learning inspired me to try and learn Python so I could understand the example code, and hopefully make something similar in the future (something I am beginning to look into now!)</p><br>
    <p>Since beginning my journey with Python on Codecademy, I've gone on to learn a lot more languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and more. After working my way out of tutorial limbo, I have been working on more creative projects due to my inspiration from my dissertations, but also the mass of AI content that I discovered around the same time like AI Dungeon and some video games. As my learning has been untraditional, I think I have a unique background when it comes to applying for software and data jobs but I am hoping to find a position where I can turn my theoretical knowledge into practical ability more.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What aspects of your work are you most passionate about and why?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am passionate about self-development. I love having the opportunity to learn more so I can deliver work that is more helpful and a higher standard for customers. At Geniuslead, I was given opportunities to learn more about AWS software, and was given a training project to do with SSMl, S3 and API Gateway. I managed to complete it before my contract was up, and wrote some process notes for the other developers if they wanted to use it as a reference in the future. Currently, I am learning more about electronics and engineering manufacturing process with Teledyne. I am finding it really interesting to see another aspect of the product development process. I enjoy learning new things, and with this sector being continuously updated, this is the job sector for me.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What would you consider some of your biggest personal and professional accomplishments?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Professionally, my biggest achievement was the story telling skill I made for Geniuslead. I programmed this skill using node.js using the Jovo v3 framework which would make the code compatible to both Alexa and Google applications (and others, if the correct code was added). I also used several AWS skills which I hadn't previously known so that the applications would find the story in a remote database, and then read it using different SSML voices for different characters. I also got the chance to flex my creative writing skills from university, to find and rewrite fairytales and fables from around the world to fit the limits that the appstores had memory-wise. I had a lot of fun making this skill, and celebrating when it was working successfully.</p><br>
    <p>Personally, my biggest personal (software) accomplishment is my narrative choose-your-story chatbot. I was inspired to make this from a Python chatbot course I did on Codecademy and from being introduced to Dungeons and Dragons by a close friend. This chatbot is my first step into machine learning, and I am thoroughly enjoying adding more chapters and game-like characteristics to it. For example, I am adding a reputation function so that all your choices affect which of three endings you will play through (alongside other factors like health, funds and inventory). The amount of different ending scenarios and random characteristics, shows how much more complex this project is compared to others I have done in the past, and how much my ability is progressing!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What are you looking for right now?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>At this moment in time, I am doing temp work and I would love to be taken for a postgraduate position or permanently in a graduate position. I am want to go further with my education, and would love to do this while accumalating professional experience.</p>
