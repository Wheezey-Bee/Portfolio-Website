This is an active depository where I will be uploading the changes I make to my portfolio website. At this stage in time, I am redesigning it and making it more interactive. As I've been very bad at working on my projects since starting a new job, I am making it my new years resolution to be more active on my github account!

All I've done today is make the bones of my website and added in some of the html data that I had in my previous website project. I have also drawn out a plan for myself which I will be working through.
